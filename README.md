# Nictiz R4 ELZ

This repository contains HL7 FHIR R4 compliant profiles and related conformance materials for ELZ (Dutch: Eerstelijnszorg, English: Primary Care). Currently in development and therefore not yet suitable for implementation. The FHIR IG, also in draft status, can be found at the [informatiestandaarden wiki](https://informatiestandaarden.nictiz.nl/wiki/hg:V1_FHIR_ELZ).

This repository is maintained by the Dutch National Institute for ICT in Healthcare (Nictiz).

## Official releases

Resources in this repository should be considered unstable and not suited for immediate implementation. Stable versions will be released using the FHIR package mechanism on [Simplifier](https://simplifier.net/packages).

## Profiling guidelines

The profiling guidelines for this project can be found at the [informatiestandaarden wiki](http://informatiestandaarden.nictiz.nl/wiki/FHIR:V1.0_FHIR_Profiling_Guidelines_R4).
