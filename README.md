# Nictiz-R4-GPCare-ParamedicalCare

This repository contains HL7 FHIR R4 compliant profiles and related conformance materials for the information standard GP Care and Paramedical Care (Dutch: Huisartsenzorg en Paramedische Zorg). Currently in development and therefore not yet suitable for implementation. The FHIR IG, also in draft status, can be found at the [informatiestandaarden wiki](https://informatiestandaarden.nictiz.nl/wiki/Vdraft/FHIR_GPCare_ParamedicalCare).

This repository is maintained by the Dutch National Intitute for ICT in Healthcare (Nictiz).

## Official releases

Resources in this repository should be considered unstable and not suited for immediate implementation. Stable versions will be released using the FHIR package mechanism on [Simplifier](https://simplifier.net/packages). At the moment, no package has been released for the current project.

## Profiling guidelines

The profiling guidelines for this project can be found at the [informatiestandaarden wiki](http://informatiestandaarden.nictiz.nl/wiki/FHIR:V1.0_FHIR_Profiling_Guidelines_R4).
